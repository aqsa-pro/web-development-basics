#### 1\. What is HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create web pages. It describes the structure of a webpage using elements and tags.

*   **HyperText**: Text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through links, also known as hyperlinks.
*   **Markup Language**: A system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text.

#### 2\. Basic Structure of an HTML Document

An HTML document has a defined structure that includes several key elements:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to HTML!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

*   `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type and version of HTML.
*   `<html>`: The root element of an HTML page.
*   `<head>`: Contains meta-information about the document.
*   `<title>`: Sets the title of the document, which appears in the browser tab.
*   `<body>`: Contains the content of the document.

#### 3\. Creating Your First HTML Document

Let's create a simple HTML document:

1.  Open a text editor (like VS Code, Sublime Text, or Notepad++).
2.  Type the following code:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first HTML document.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

3.  Save the file with a `.html` extension (e.g., `index.html`).
4.  Open the file in a web browser to see the result.

#### 4\. Common HTML Tags

Here are some common HTML tags you will use frequently:

*   **Headings**: `<h1>` to `<h6>` for creating headings, `<h1>` being the largest and `<h6>` the smallest.
    
    ```
    <h1>Main Heading</h1> <h2>Subheading</h2>
    ```
    
*   **Paragraph**: `<p>` for creating paragraphs.
    
    ```
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    ```
    
*   **Links**: `<a>` for creating hyperlinks.

    ```
    <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
    ```
    
*   **Images**: `<img>` for embedding images.

    ```
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image">
    ```
