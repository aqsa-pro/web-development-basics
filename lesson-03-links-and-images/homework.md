# Homework: Links and Images in HTML

## Instructions

Complete the following tasks to practice creating hyperlinks and adding images in HTML. Submit your work as a single HTML file named `homework_lesson3.html`.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Creating Hyperlinks

1. Create a new HTML file and add the standard `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration and basic HTML structure with `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
2. Inside the `<body>` tag, demonstrate the use of the following types of hyperlinks:
    - **Basic Link**: Create a link to an external website.
    - **Opening Links in a New Tab**: Create a link that opens in a new tab.
    - **Linking to an Email Address**: Create a link that opens the default email client with a pre-filled recipient email.
    - **Linking to a Section within the Same Page**: Create a link that navigates to a specific section within the same HTML document.

### Task 2: Adding and Formatting Images

1. In the same HTML file, demonstrate the use of the following image-related tags and attributes:
    - **Basic Image**: Add an image with a `src` and `alt` attribute.
    - **Adjusting Image Size**: Add an image and adjust its size using the `width` and `height` attributes.
    - **Using External Images**: Add an image using an external URL as the `src`.
    - **Adding a Link to an Image**: Make an image clickable, so that clicking the image navigates to an external website.

### Task 3: Absolute vs. Relative Paths

1. Create examples in your HTML file that show the difference between absolute and relative paths:
    - **Absolute Path**: Create a link and an image using an absolute URL.
    - **Relative Path**: Create a link and an image using a relative path.

### Task 4: Creating a Simple Webpage with Links and Images

1. Create a complete HTML document that includes:
    - A header with a title and a navigation menu using links.
    - A main content area with sections that include images and internal links.
    - A footer with contact information.
